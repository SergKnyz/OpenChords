.A                                                      
 Sing the wondrous love of Jesus,                       
.E7                     A                               
 Sing His mercy and His grace;                          
.A               D                                      
 In the mansions bright and blessed,                    
.A        E7            A                               
 He'll prepare for us a place.                          

[C]
.        A                                              
 When we all get to heaven,                             
.                B7                E7                   
 What a day of rejoicing that will be;                  
.        A       D                                      
 When we all see Jesus,                                 
.      A        E7             A                        
 We'll sing and shout the victory.                      

[V2]
.A                                                      
 While we walk the pilgrim pathway,                     
.E7                          A                          
 Clouds will over spread the sky;                       
.A                   D                                  
 But when travelling days are over,                     
.A     E7            A                                  
 Not a shadow, not a sigh.                              

[V3]
.A                                                      
 Let us then be true and faithful,                      
.E7                    A                                
 Trusting serving everyday;                             
.A                   D                                  
 Just one glimpse of Him in glory,                      
.A        E7              A                             
 Will the toils of life repay.                          

[V4]
.A                                                      
 Onward to the prize before us,                         
.E7                      A                              
 Soon His beauty we'll behold;                          
.A               D                                      
 Soon the pearly gates will open,                       
.A        E7                   A                        
 We shall tread the streets of gold.
