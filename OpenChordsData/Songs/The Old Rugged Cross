.     A                      D                          
 On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,          
.    E7                      A                          
 The emblem of suff'ring and shame;                     
.      A                             D                  
 And I love that old cross where the dearest and best,  
.      E7                        A                      
 For a world of lost sinners was slain.                 
.                                                       

[C]
.        E7                     A                       
 So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,                  
.        D                      A                       
 Till my trophies at last I lay down;                   
.       A                       D                       
 I will cling to the old rugged cross,                  
.      A              E7        A                       
 And exchange it some day for a crown.                  

[V2]
.        A                      D                       
 Oh that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,    
.      E7                      A                        
 Has a wondrous attraction for me;                      
.        A                         A                    
 For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,         
.   E7                   A                              
 To bear it to dark Calvary.                            

[V3]
.       A                              D                
 In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine, 
.  E7                A                                  
 A wondrous beauty I see;                               
.         A                       D                     
 For twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,    
.   E7                  A                               
 To pardon and sanctify me.                             

[V4]
.       A                       D                       
 To the old rugged cross I will ever be true,           
.    E7                        A                        
 Its shame and reproach gladly bear;                    
.           A                      D                    
 Then He'll call me some day to my home far away,       
.          E7                 A                         
 Where his glory forever I'll share.
