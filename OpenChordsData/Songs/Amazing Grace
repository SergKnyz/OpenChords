. D      D7        G         D                                                              
 Amazing grace how sweet the sound                      
.     Bm      E           A  A7                                                             
 that saved a wretch like me;                           
.  D        D7       G       D                                                              
 I once was lost but now I'm found,                     
.    Bm        A     G   D                                                                  
 was blind but now I see.                               

[V2]
.     D          D7        G        D                                                       
 Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,               
.    Bm       E       A      A7                                                             
 and grace my fears relieved;                           
.    D        D7       G       D                                                            
 How precious did that grace appear                     
.    Bm     A       G      D                                                                
 the hour I first believed!                             

[V3]
.        D    D7       G                                                                    
 Through many dangers, toils,                           
.    D        Bm     E     A    A7                                                          
 and snares I have already come;                        
.     D          D7         G         D                                                     
 'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far               
.    Bm         A       G    D                                                              
 and grace will lead me home.                           

[V4]
.     D          D7        G                                                                
 When we've been there ten thousand                     
.D            Bm      E      A   A7                                                         
 years bright shining as the sun;                       
.      D       D7      G          D                                                         
 We've no less days to sing God's praise                
.     Bm        A       G   D                                                               
 than when we'd first begun!
