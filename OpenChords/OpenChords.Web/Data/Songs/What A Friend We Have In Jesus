.D                        G                                  
 What a friend we have in Jesus,                             
.D                           A                               
 All ours sins and griefs to bear;                           
.D                   G                                       
 What a privilege to carry,                                  
.A                    D                                      
 Everything to God in prayer!                                
.A                     D                                     
 O what peace we often forfeit,                              
.G      D                A                                   
 O what needless pain we bear;                               
.D                     G                                     
 All because we do not carry,                                
.A                    D                                      
 Everything to God in prayer!                                

[V2]
.D                      G                                    
 Have we trials and temptations?                             
.D                   A                                       
 Is there trouble anywhere?                                  
.D                     G                                     
 We should never be discouraged,                             
.A                      D                                    
 Take it to the Lord in prayer.                              
.A                       D                                   
 Can we find a friend so faithful?                           
.G        D               A                                  
 Who will all our sorrows share?                             
.D                     G                                     
 Jesus knows our every weakness;                             
.A                      D                                    
 Take it to the Lord in prayer.                              

[V3]
.D                     G                                     
 Are we weak and heavy laden,                                
.D                       A                                   
 Cumbered with a load of care?                               
.D                          G                                
 Precious Saviour still our refuge;                          
.A                      D                                    
 Take it to the Lord in prayer.                              
.A                         D                                 
 Do thy friends despise forsake thee?                        
.G       D              A                                    
 Take it to the Lord in prayer!                              
.D                          G                                
 In His arms Heâ€™ll take and shield thee;                     
.A                       D                                   
 Thou wilt find a solace there.
